# 🧮 Data Structure Algorithms (C / C++ / Java Implementation)

Welcome to my **Data Structure Course Repository**!  
This collection includes implementations of **fundamental data structure algorithms** written in **C**, **C++**, and **Java**.  

Each program demonstrates a key concept in **data organization, manipulation, and algorithmic problem-solving** — essential for building efficient and optimized software systems.

## ⚙️ Topics Covered

### 🧩 Array Operations
1. **Array Operation**  
   📄 `ArrayOperation.c` | `ArrayOperation.java`  
   ➤ Demonstrates array creation, traversal, insertion, deletion, and search operations.

2. **Matrix Summation and Multiplication**  
   📄 `MatrixSummationAndMultiplication.c` | `MatrixOperation.java`  
   ➤ Performs addition and multiplication of 2D matrices using nested loops.

---

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
1. **Binary Search**  
   📄 `BinarySearch.c` | `BinarySearch.java`  
   ➤ Implements divide-and-conquer search on sorted arrays for efficient lookup.

---

### 🔢 Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**  
   📄 `BubleSort.c` | `BubleSort.cpp` | `BubleSort.java`  
   ➤ Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements to sort the list in ascending order.

2. **Insertion Sort**  
   📄 `InsertionSort.c` | `InsertionSort.java`  
   ➤ Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements in place.

3. **Selection Sort**  
   📄 `SelectionSort.c` | `SelectionSort.java`  
   ➤ Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and places it correctly.

4. **Merge Sort**  
   📄 `MargeSort.java`  
   ➤ Recursively divides and merges subarrays for efficient O(n log n) sorting.
